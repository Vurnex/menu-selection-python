# Python Menu Selection

A simple program that presents the user with a menu and allows them to select predefined options in the command line. 
The theme for the program is a patient and staff information management menu. The user can enter new information into a file or delete the file.

This assignment was originally completed in Fall 2019 during my Freshman year of college (IT Major). I slightly changed the formatting and added some code to make it easier to read and navigate.

## What I learned while re-visiting this project

After returning to this project, I remembered that clearing the terminal in Python has different commands for Windows and other systems. For Windows it is cls, while on other platforms it is clear. I implemented a function that will clear the terminal when called. This function determines the appropriate command to use based on the OS it is being executed on.
